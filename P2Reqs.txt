full stack web application
leveraging Azure DB, a Java backend leveraging Spring MVC, and a JS frontend
Java Backend should have unit testing
Both frontend and backend should be deployed to Azure VMs
Be prepared to talk about your team structure and your approach to devops and agile development

Presentation: 20 minutes

Team structure recommendations:
    "What if I'm not the best programmer and other people are better at doing this
    than me? :((()))"
        Even so, there are plenty of responsibilities to go around:
            You should have a single person in charge of Azure resources (devops engineer)
            You should have a single person managing git merges and branches
            You still have to do unit testing - this can be someone's entire responsitibility
            You will most definitely need *multiple* people working mostly on the front end

I would like you all to have some plan on what your project will be... by Wednesday
