        <!-- there are multiple ways to style:
        external (stylesheets) 
        internal (within the head)
        inline (within the element)
        best one?
        external, without a doubt, because being able to modify styles without
        changing your html file is good
        also, it would allow for multiple pages to use the same styling
        -->

        <!-- metadata : like stylesheets, title of website, charset (character encodings) -->
        <title>Pokedex V2</title>
